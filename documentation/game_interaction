Example of answering a riddle to open a container:

"You see an odd pile of leaves on the ground. It looks as if someone was trying to hide something."

> take leaves

"The leaves were covering what looks to be a safe set into the ground. The material of the safe appears to be metallic, is cold the touch. There is a lever on the little door."

> open safe

"As soon as you place your hand on the lever, a vibration fills your head and you hear a fait voice: 'Answer my riddle, and I will grant you my contents'"

> answer to riddle

"You think your response to the safe and you hear a click, though nothing appears to be different about the safe."

> open safe

"The door easily slides open. Inside, you see two items, a key and a piece of paper."

> take key

"You examine the key, it has the word 'Scorpio' engraved in the head."

> read paper

"The paper is blank on both sides. Examining it you see nothing special about it."

> look in safe

"The safe appears to be empty."


The player should now have in their inventory:
- Scorpio key
- Blank paper

The safe should be marked as unlocked, opened, and empty
The node where the safe is located should be marked as visited once
