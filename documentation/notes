Schemas

WorldNode {
  x: int,
  y: int,
  dungeon: string,
  visited: boolean,
}

x: x-coordinate
y: y-coordinate
dungeon: string indicating what dungeon the node is a part of; the world is identified by the string token 'world'

visited: True if the player has visited the node, will have to update this for multiple players, after creating the players table


Dungeon {
  description: string,
  location: foreign_key(WorldNode)
}

description: Text that explains the dungeon, not sure when the player would see this
location: this is a foreign key ref to the world node from which the player can access this dungeon
In the javascript, have a function called enter_dungeon()

NodeText {
  unvisited: string
  visited: string
  look: string
}

unvisited: Text presented the first time player visits node
visited: Text for when player visits a second time
look: Text for when player looks at node but has not visited



as things are taken by the player, their description should disappear from the game text

maybe should have an array of objects, each object is a dictionary with description text?

currently, text is outputted to the console when a player moves onto a node. The text can have several states, depending if the player has visited the node or not, or if they're merely examining it

to get a minimum viable product
add multiple player functionality
add object interaction within a node
